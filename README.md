### Introduction and Motivation

A major problem being faced by municipalities around the world is maintaining the condition of roads be it summer, the monsoons (when it is at its worst) or any weather condition as a matter of fact. And although it’s the responsibility of the authorities to make sure the roads are free of damage, at times they overlook the problem, and most times don’t even know that the problem exists. According to indiatoday, the number of deaths over the past 3 years stands at 9300 and with over 25000 injuries. 
 
Maintaining the road condition is a challenge with constant weather changes, wear and tear, low budgets for the municipalities. Also, not to forget keeping people informed is a task. So, this is an application aimed at solving the challenges mentioned. A reporting system, where the citizen can capture the scene of an area, which will be fed to a machine learning model that will geocode, validate and track down potholes in the scene. This would be achieved by training for object tracking on multiple images and developed using convolutional neural networks. Users can see the damage on the roads using a mobile application or through their browsers. A dynamic report is also generated for the closest authority of concern which they can view and update to create and manage work orders using their own jurisdiction-based web/mobile app-based dashboard.

### Motivation

Keeping the roads in good condition along with tracking damages is a challenge with constant changes in weather, low budgets for the municipalities. Not to forget keeping the people informed is a task. This project is aimed at solving the challenges mentioned above. In articles covered by Guardian News & Media potholes took a deadly toll in 2017, claiming almost 10 lives daily. IndiaTimes stated that "Bereaved Father Mr. Dadarao" filled 600 Potholes in Mumbai in memory of the son he lost in a road accident! Inshorts reported, potholes killed more people than terrorists reporting 14,926 deaths in road accidents.
 
Keeping the roads in good condition along with tracking damages is a challenge with constant changes in weather, low budgets for the municipalities. Not to forget keeping the people informed is a task. This project was aimed at solving the challenges mentioned above by creating an interactive environment between the municipality and any person who identifies a pothole in a dynamic environment.
